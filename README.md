# Hospital Database — Look Up Patients for Employees
Capstone Project

# Purpose / Problem Statement
This project simulates a simple hospital database system that allows hospital employees to look up patient information using a patient’s first name, last name, and date of birth. It addresses the need for quick patient verification in healthcare settings, especially when handling large volumes of patient data or when full records are not immediately available.

# Target Audience
-This program is ideal for:
<br>Aspiring healthcare technologists interested in how data systems might be used to organize and retrieve patient information.
<br>Entry-level Python programmers looking for real-world applications of APIs, conditional logic, and string formatting.


# Solution + Limitations
-Solutions:
<br>-Fetches a list of random users from the Random User API.
<br>-Simulates real-world patient lookup by requiring key identifying information 
<br>-Supports immediate feedback by displaying the results in a readable format

-Limitations:
<br>-The data is not connected to a real database; it uses mock data from the Random User API.
<br>-Does not store or update patient data.
<br>-Exact matching only: Slight misspellings or different date formats (e.g., "1/1/2001" vs "2001-01-01") will result in no match.




# Key Features/ Components
<br>-User Input: First name, last name, and date of birth.
<br>-Patient Lookup: Matches input to randomly generated patients.
<br>-Information Display: Shows gender, email, country, and nationality.
<br>-Fallback Display: Generates random details if no exact match is found.
<br>-API Integration: Uses the Random User API for data.


# Technical Challenges + Future Plans
-Challenges
<br>Matching user input to randomly generated data (rare chance of finding a match).
<br>Couldn't storing the info in a CSV file

-Future Plans
<br>Add search filters like gender, age range, or country.
<br>Include authentication for staff login before accessing patient data.



# Project Timeline
-Day one
<br>Define project idea and purpose.<br>
-Day two
<br>Learn how to add the data from Random User API.<br>
-Day three
<br>Started writing the code (how would they search the patient and what would come up)<br>
-Day four
<br>Finalizing last minunet changes and errors<br>
-Day five
<br> Writeing the README and prepare for subission<br>
